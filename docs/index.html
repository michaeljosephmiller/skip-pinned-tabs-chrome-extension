      <h1>Welcome to Skip Pinned Tabs</h1>
      <p>
        Skip Pinned Tabs is a Chrome extension that allows you to quickly and
        easily skip over pinned tabs when cycling through your active tabs.
      </p>
      <p>
        With Skip Pinned Tabs, you can navigate through your open tabs more
        efficiently, without having to click through all of your pinned tabs
        every time you switch to a new tab. This extension is perfect for anyone
        who frequently works with a large number of open tabs.
